# borough-battle
In this game, the user plays against the computer in a turn-based text game in an attempt to take over the five boroughs: Leaf Village, Sand Village, Cloud Village, Stone Village, and Mist Village

GAMEPLAY:

The game is divided into three parts: the placement, the building, and the final battle.

In the placement, both the computer and the user have 10 soldiers which they can distribute any way they want in the five boroughs. The user goes first, and then the computer randomly assigns its ten soldiers. Both the user and computer must then pick their base borough. The user goes first, then the computer picks one. The computer can not pick the same base as the user.

After this placement, the building occurs. The computer picks a random number between 10 and 25, which is how many turns this stage involves. In the building, the user and computer take turns in placing additional soldiers on the board. For each turn they can place one soldier in one of their boroughs. The computer chooses a random borough to place one of its soldiers in and announces this to the user. The user should not know how many turns are left.

Once the number of turns are over, the Final Battle takes place. In this round, each of the boroughs involves a battle between the soldiers. In each borough, the team with the higher number of soldiers wins and scores a number of points equal to the ratio between the two armies rounded down. For example, if the computer has 10 soldiers and the user has 4 then the computer scores 2 points (10/4 = 2.5 which is rounded down to 2). This score is doubled if a user wins its base borough. For example, if the user has 7 soldiers in its base borough and the computer has 2, then the user will score 6 points (7/2 = 3.5 which is rounded down to 3 and then doubled to 6).

The scores are tallied and the player with the most points wins. If the score is tied, then the player with the most boroughs wins. If that is also a tie, then the computer wins

Have fun playing my game :)
